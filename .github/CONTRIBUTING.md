# Contributing

Bug reports, model reports, ideas, translations and code are welcome. Be kind: [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/<you>/ugreen-nas-control && cd ugreen-nas-control
just setup && just check
```

`just check` runs everything CI runs; `just setup` enables the pre-commit hook (staged-only format and syntax checks); `just fmt` formats every file type. With nix installed nothing else is needed. Tools, recipes and code style: [docs/development.md](../docs/development.md).

## Branches

Feature PRs target `next`; `main` holds releases only. Branch roles: [docs/releasing.md](../docs/releasing.md#branches).

## Workflow

1. Branch from `next` (`git fetch upstream && git switch -c my-change upstream/next`).
2. One topic per PR. Rebase on `next` right before you open it.
3. Several PRs touching the same file: stack them (each branched on the previous) or send one PR. Do not open parallel PRs that edit the same lines.
4. Add one fragment `.changes/<slug>.md` ([format](../.changes/README.md)), or ask for the label `no-changelog` when nothing a user sees changes.
5. `just check` before you push. Run `just harness` and look at UI changes; say in the PR which model you tested on, or that you used the harness only.
6. PR title: `type(scope): summary`, for example `feat(led): night mode per bay`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `model`, `docs`, `chore`. The squash commit uses it.

## Rules

- Never edit `plugin/ugreen-nas-control.plg`, `CHANGELOG.md` or a version number. The release workflow writes them; CI rejects PRs that touch them.
- Never commit generated files (JS bundles, PNG icons, `.build/`, the models tables by hand): [docs/development.md](../docs/development.md#generated-files).
- New texts need keys in every language: [docs/translations.md](../docs/translations.md).
- Scripts are TypeScript on Bun. No Python, no Node.
- Keep docs to current facts: no history, no marketing words.
- Comments only for facts the code cannot show: hardware register sources, safety invariants and why they hold, Unraid or browser quirks, deliberate deviations from the obvious approach.
- No comment that restates the code, names the next block, narrates a step or tells history.
- AI-assisted PRs are fine if you tested the result (harness or hardware) and say so.

## What CI checks

Everything `just check` runs (format, PHP syntax, XML, docs links, models, generated files, plus the parts below). Go: lint, tests with `-race`, static build, the Go tools against the recorded goldens. Shell: shellcheck, shfmt on the few remaining files. Frontend: format, lint, types, tests, i18n parity, the sources build. Plugin: manifest, `.plg` render, fragments. Models registry. Generated files: none tracked outside `.gitattributes`. Workflows: actionlint, zizmor. Guard: no `.plg` or `CHANGELOG.md` in the PR, fragment present. Release PR: the rebuild equals the draft release. The single required check is `ci-ok`.

## Report a new model

[docs/cli.md](../docs/cli.md#report-a-model) (`ugreen-nas-ctl report` and the form). To add the model yourself: [docs/development.md](../docs/development.md#add-a-model); status words: [docs/hardware.md](../docs/hardware.md#how-verification-works).

## Labels

- Type, matching the `.changes` fragment type: `bug` = fix, `enhancement` = feat, `model` = model, `documentation` = docs, `chore` = chore. `no-changelog`: the CI guard skips the fragment check.
- Area, one per component: `area: fans`, `area: leds`, `area: panel` (front panel buttons, beeper, power-on after power loss), `area: widget` (Unraid dashboard), `area: mqtt`, `area: install` (install, update, daemon start/stop), `area: ui` (plugin page), `area: site`, `area: tooling`.
- Status: `needs hardware test` (writes registers or unconfirmed hardware: test on a device before release), `release` (release prep and tracking).
- Area and type labels are set automatically: type from the issue form, area from the form's Area field (issues) or the changed paths (PRs). Fix a wrong one by hand; it is not removed again.
- Other: `model-report`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`.
